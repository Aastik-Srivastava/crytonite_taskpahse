check out a permissions of a file or directory using ls -l

chown - change ownership
chown can only be invoked by the root user

check what groups you are part of with the id command

chgrp - change group

hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l

-rw-r--r-- 1 hacker hacker    0 May 22 13:42 college_file

3 characters denoting permissions for the owning user ,
3 characters denoting the permissions for the owning group (now you understand this as well!),
and 3 characters denoting the permissions that all other access 

r - user/group/other can read the file (or list the directory)
w - user/group/other can modify the files (or create/delete files in the directory)
x - user/group/other can execute the file as a program (or can enter the directory, e.g., using `cd`)
- - nothing 

chmod allows you to tweak permissions with the mode format of WHO+/-WHAT, where WHO is user/group/other and WHAT is read/write/execute.

u=rw sets read and write permissions for the user, and wipes the execute permission
o=x sets only executable permissions for the world, wiping read and write
a=rwx sets read, write, and executable permissions for the user, group, and world!

chmod u=rw,g=r /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group permissions to read-only
chmod a=r,u=rw /challenge/pwn will set the user permissions to read and write, and the group and world permissions to read-only

you can zero out permissions with -
o=- /challenge/pwn 

The "Set User ID" (SUID) permissions bit allows the user to run a program as the owner of that program's file.
    chmod u+s [program]
