Documnetation helps us to figure out which argumnets to give and get help with commands.

man - command to read manual of any command

SYNTAX:      man command_name

man man - to read a manual about using manual itself

to search in a manual we use /filename >> hit n to go to the next result and N to go to the previous result

to quit a manual we use q

--help or -h also might give instrusctions on fucntion usage.

Some commands, rather than being programs with man pages and help options, are built into the shell itself. These are called builtins. 
Builtins are invoked just like commands, but the shell handles them internally instead of launching other programs.

You can get a list of shell builtins by running the builtin help

can get help on a specific one by passing it to the help builtin as an argument.
( eg: help cd )
