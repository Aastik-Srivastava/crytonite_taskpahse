Linux filesystem is a "tree". That is, it has a root (written as /)

absulute paths are complete paths beginning at root.
relative paths begin at the directory we are in.

/ - root where all directeries begin
cd - change directory
~ - this is the { home/user } path in short hand ( the expansion of ~ is an absolute path  )
./ - explicit relative path to refer to the same directory

the following absolute paths are all identical to each other:
    /challenge
    /challenge/.
    /challenge/./././././././././
    /./././challenge/././
